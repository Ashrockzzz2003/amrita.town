## have a personal website? join us

are you an amrita student? do you have a personal website? we'd love to have you as a part of this.

emphasis on the _personal_ part, btw - we're looking for websites that tell other humans about yourself, not just show off your skills to recruiters.

1. make sure your website is a personal website and it has contact details somewhere.
2. add these links to your website - most people put it in the footer, but presentation is up to you. just make sure it's easily accessible.

    ```html
    <!-- example (you can show these 4 links however you want) -->
    <div>
        <a href="https://amrita.town">amrita.town</a>
        <a href="https://amrita.town/prev">← prev</a>
        <a href="https://amrita.town/random">⚄ random</a>
        <a href="https://amrita.town/next">next →</a>
    </div>
    ```


    **note:** if your website is not on the root path, add a `site` query parameter to each URL like this - `https://amrita.town/next?site=example.com/mypath`.
      
3. send a pr to add yourself to `src/members.json` on our [github](https://github.com/amritadottown/website). feel free to tell us a little bit about yourself too!

we're looking forward to seeing you there.

## our vision

you are not a user. you are not a statistic. you are a person.

a person, with a unique sense of self, and a unique experience worth sharing. expressing yourself as you are, and who you could be, is our mission.

picture this, a place on the internet, with your name on it. this place looks exactly the way you want it to look. a place made for other people to drop in, and get to know you. a place that truly belongs to you.

what if you could truly express yourself as you are, with the power of free and open technology that's only gotten better as the years have gone by.

imagine a place where you could post about your interests, rant about your day, a guestbook for others to drop by and leave notes to you to read, blogs about what you're passionate about, a place to post the photos you want others to see, or the books and movies and art that inspires you.

a personal website is the answer.

it's the first step towards claiming ownership of your digital identity. if that notion excites you, read on.

### perfect websites are not the goal

building a website has always been an attainable goal for anyone. unfortunately, the modern web has concealed this in a veil of complexity and 'professionalism'.

the point is ownership, not perfection.

in fact, imperfection is encouraged if the end result is a true expression of humanity and authenticity.

free yourself of what you think a website _should_ look like and make one that speaks to who you are. the only condition is to have a place you're proud of and a place that is truly your own.

perfect is for web designers and people working jobs. do you speak perfect sentences to your close friends?

### how do i find others?

[amrita.town](amrita.town) is a webring, a place connecting all of your online homes, built up of personal websites made by students of amrita. each website contains a widget connecting you to other websites in the webring and this website.

a collection of websites, loving crafted by their creators to be true representations of who they are. that's what we envision the internet to truly be like.

join us in trying to bring back this vision of the internet.

you can go ahead and meet us irl if you want to.
